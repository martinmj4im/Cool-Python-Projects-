            Theme: This milestone focuses on loading two of the ETS files
            (trips.txt and shapes.txt) into Python data structures
            and developing a text interface to access these data structures.

MS2 Topics: Tuples
            Sets
            Dictionairies
            Theme: This milestone focuses on a few objectives. 
            (a) extend the menu system as shown below,
            (b) add the ability to save (and load) the created data structures
                to (and from) a file, and
            (c) implement a graphical user interface (GUI) where the user can
                plot bus routes on a map of Edmonton.
